It typically occurs near the beginning of most calendar years. The address reports on the nation's budget, economy, news, agenda, progress, and achievements. It also outlines the president's legislative proposals for the coming year. Woodrow Wilson giving his first State of the Union address on December 2, 1913, was the first time since 1801 that such an address was made in person before a joint session of Congress, initiating the modern trend.\n"
